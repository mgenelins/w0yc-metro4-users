Howdy!

Jump on the air on Metro4 (462.650 141.3hz), call for “Gopher Radio” and receive on-the-air permission to be on Metro4.

Metro 4 is presently a standalone system (not linked) that has a lot of users. For a full list of users, see our GitHub repo here:

Metro 4 is sponsored by The Gopher Amateur Radio Club at The University of Minnesota. It's been on the air on 462.650 for about 10 years now, and one of our club members, Shane Young, K0SEY, sponsors the system, antenna and upkeep of the system. It is comprised of a Motorola GR300 repeater (two 50 Watt Motorola GM300 Mobile radios) with a Zetron Community Repeater Controller panel on it. It responds to a number of PL tones that are for private use by our club members -- 141.3 is the only open PL/CTCSS tone for your use for now. Joining our club allows you to ask for you and your family's own private PL tone for your own use! 

Metro 4 is located on the St. Paul University of Minnesota Campus at Gortner Ave and Buford Ave on one of our tall campus buildings. It shares the site with several other radio systems.

In July of 2024, Todd Dugdale - KAF6430 - donated a second GMRS repetar on 462.575 156.7hz. It's up on the University of Minnesota's East Bank Campus at The Malcolm Moos Medical Sciences Building, or 'Moos Tower' for short. You can request access via the mygrms.com website as well. It seems to be performing well.

If you are an amateur radio operator, we have a number of amateur repeaters on the same site. These include:
442.425 - W0YC/R - 114.8hz, P25.
462.650 - WQCQ790 - "Metro 4" 141.3hz
223.900 - KE0NA/R - "The Aggrandizer" - 100.0hz
444.425 - W0YC/R backup to the Minneapolis system - 100.0hz

I am looking forward to meeting you on the air and granting you permission on the air to use Metro 4!

Howdy!

Jump on the air on Metro 16 (462.575 156.7+ hz), call for “Gopher Radio” and receive on-the-air permission to be on Metro 16.

Metro 16 is presently a standalone system (not linked) that has a lot of users. For a full list of users, see our GitHub repo here:

Metro 16 went on the air in July of 2024 and is Sponsored by The Gopher Amateur Radio Club at The University of Minnesota and Todd, KAF6430. It has a sister repeater in St. Paul named 'Metro 4.'

Metro 4 is sponsored by The Gopher Amateur Radio Club at The University of Minnesota. It's been on the air on 462.650 for about 10 years now, and one of our club members, Shane Young, K0SEY, sponsors the system, antenna and upkeep of the system. It is comprised of a Motorola GR300 repeater (two 50 Watt Motorola GM300 Mobile radios) with a Zetron Community Repeater Controller panel on it. It responds to a number of PL tones that are for private use by our club members -- 141.3 is the only open PL/CTCSS tone for your use for now. Joining our club allows you to ask for you and your family's own private PL tone for your own use! 

Metro 16 is located on the On Minneapolis U of M East Bank Campus, Malcolm Moos Medical Sciences Tower, or 'Moos Tower', a 380 ft. building overlooking much of downtown Minneapolis. This system has wide area coverage.

Metro 16 shares the site with several other radio systems.

If you are an amateur radio operator, we have a number of amateur repeaters on the same site. These include:
444.425 - KA0KMJ/R - 114.8hz.
443.425 - W0YC  B - D-Star repeater.
443.000 - NH7CY/R - DMR / MotoTrbo repeater linked to the K4USD network.
927.900 - NH7CY/R - FM and Mixed mode DMR, P25 repeater on the Brandmesiter Network.
144.390 - W0YC-5 - APRS two-way gateway.

I am looking forward to meeting you on the air and granting you permission on the air to use Metro 16!
